**Last updated**: 2026-05-07 (in-game year 2029→2030) — **Phase 3 (UI implementation) is now active.** All Phase 2 + analytical-layer items closed (warehouse + ingest + L3 analytics + real-MLB history backfill + analytical refinements); the analytical layer reads zero open items. **D13 (two-tier player scope) shipped same-day** — `SaveConfig.reference_scope_enabled` + CLI `--reference-scope/--no-reference-scope` flags + `_diamond_settings` warehouse admin table for persistence. Reference cohort = "≥1 MLB appearance" (PA OR IP, refined from D13's original PA-only definition); expands `_scoped_players` from 15,992 → 35,261 on the live warehouse. **Next start point per UI_DESIGN.md build order: D15 stat dictionary Python module** (`diamond/dictionary/`, ~150 entries consolidating reconcile.py ColSpec.notes + advanced/ docstrings + DATA_NOTES.md), then player page → demotion/promotion → leaderboards → universes/charts → AI overlay → cockpit → reviews → setup wizard → sync triggers.

## One-line summary

Phases 1-2 closed; analytical CLI surface complete (`diamond draft / records / awards / hof / fetch-history`); real MLB history through 2025 backfilled and integrated into records + awards + HOF leaderboards. Phase 3 (UI) is the active phase, not yet started.

## What works today

- **Project skeleton**: Python 3.14 + DuckDB + Polars + Typer; package at
  `src/diamond/`; editable install via `pip install -e .[dev]`.
- **CLI**: `diamond decode`, `diamond decode-codes`, `diamond reconcile`,
  `diamond coverage`, `diamond advanced`, `diamond ingest`,
  `diamond draft`, `diamond records`, `diamond awards`, `diamond hof`,
  `diamond fetch-history` (Lahman + Statcast one-time backfill).
  All audit/report commands write markdown to `audit_output/` (gitignored).
- **Reconciliation harness** ([src/diamond/audit/reconcile.py](src/diamond/audit/reconcile.py))
  — per-column comparison of all 21 `import_export` Red Sox roster CSVs against
  derivations from monthly dump CSVs across the full 220-player Red Sox org tree
  (MLB + AAA + AA + A+ + A + Rookie + 2 DSL + FCL). 16 of 21 files at 100% A+B.
  See scorecard below. This stays in the codebase as a permanent regression
  check (Decision D8).
- **Verified codebooks** ([src/diamond/constants.py](src/diamond/constants.py))
  — `GameType`, `SplitId`, `AtBatResult` (at-bat domain); `AwardId` (13 codes
  cross-ref'd with league_history), `LeaderCategory` (47 of 60), `StreakId`
  (21 profiled), `BodyPart` (12 profiled); `Popularity`, `ScoutingAccuracy`,
  personality bucket helper.
- **Advanced stats library** ([src/diamond/advanced/](src/diamond/advanced/))
  — 5 tiers of modern advanced stats from at-bat data (~25 metrics). Per-tier
  modules: `contact.py`, `situational.py`, `sabermetric.py`, `defensive.py`,
  `approach.py`. Shared at-bat view in `enriched.py`; advanced-lib-scoped
  per-league-year linear weights / FIP const / lgERA in
  `advanced/league_constants.py` (kept for now — produces wOBA-scale calibration
  the audit derivation doesn't need; consolidation is a post-warehouse task).
- **League-constants module** ([src/diamond/league_constants.py](src/diamond/league_constants.py))
  — top-level module that registers two DuckDB views (`lg_constants_bat`,
  `lg_constants_pit`) sourced from `league_history_*` and keyed by
  `(league_id, year, level_id)` per Decision D11. Replaces the inline CTEs
  formerly in `reconcile.py`. Verified byte-identical reconcile output post-refactor.
- **5-layer warehouse DDL** ([src/diamond/schema/](src/diamond/schema/))
  — full `build_l0` / `build_l1_machinery` / `build_l1_reference` /
  `build_l1_event` / `build_l1_snapshot` / `build_l2` pipeline. Each
  module holds its layer's specs and builders. `scripts/smoke_warehouse.py`
  exercises the full pipeline end-to-end against the latest dump in <60s,
  asserting layer invariants (PK enforcement, scope filters, dim flatten,
  D12 scouted-rating filter, idempotency). Layer counts:
  - L0: **69 raw tables** (5.76M rows from one dump)
  - L1: 12 reference + 35 event + 21 state-snapshot + 6 `_current` views + 2 machinery (`_scoped_*`) + 1 admin (`_diamond_ingests`)
  - L2: 8 facts (`f_player_season_batting/pitching/fielding`, `f_player_career`,
    `f_team_season`, `f_league_season`, `f_pa_event`, `f_award_event`)
  - L3: 6 derived (`f_trade_participant`, `player_movements` w/ `trade_id`,
    `f_draft_class`, `f_record_player`, `f_award_career_player`,
    `f_award_franchise`)
  - History backfill (one-time): 8 `history_lahman_*` tables +
    2 `history_statcast_*` tables + 2 `history_bref_*` tables +
    2 `history_mlbapi_*` tables (awards + HOF gap-fill 2018+) +
    `history_player_id_map` (Chadwick Register). f_record_player
    UNIONs five sources ('save' / 'lahman' / 'bref' / 'statcast' /
    'merged') with `--era` CLI filter. Career rows dedup across
    sources via bbref_id crosswalk: save wins for active players;
    Lahman + BREF + Statcast merge into 'merged' source for
    pre-save retirees (Pujols Lahman 656 + BREF 30 = merged 686 HR).
    Statcast adds EV/barrel/hard-hit categories.
    f_award_career_player UNIONs save + lahman + mlbapi (with
    same dedup-on-bbref_id-in-save filter for the gap-fill rows).
    `diamond hof --era lahman` shows real Cooperstown through 2026.
- **Empirical scripts retained** in `scripts/` — `xstats_eda.py` and
  `xstats_3d.py` are the evidence behind the structural-limit D-tier verdict
  on xBA/xSLG/xwOBA. Rerun rather than re-investigate.

## Phase 1 — Audit, closed 2026-05-04

Headline reconciliation: of ~360 IE columns,
- **~270 reconcile cleanly (A/B)**
- **0 C-tier**, **0 G-tier** — all formula puzzles and int→string mappings decoded
- ~50 F-tier by design (Decision D5: plate-discipline columns; string-formatted display)
- ~7 D-tier (xBA/xSLG/xwOBA/xERA — confirmed structurally non-derivable; see DATA_NOTES)
- ~25 E-tier partial (multi-level slash-line gaps, hit_xy spray boundary — research items)

Major decodes shipped during audit (full formulas in [DATA_NOTES.md](DATA_NOTES.md)):
- DEF rating, popularity, personality buckets, scouting accuracy, VELO band, G/F bucket
- OPS+, ERA+, FIP, RC, RC/27, wOBA via `league_history_*` + halved/non-halved park factors
- SIERA via Fangraphs canonical formula (quadratic + interaction terms)
- pLi (cumulative, not average), RA (g-gs), RSG (rs/gs)
- EV buckets (75/95), Barrel (flat threshold not Statcast cone), regular-season filter, PCB-derived BIP
- Contract data via `players_contract_extension` + `players_roster_status`; current_year is 0-indexed

## Phase 2 + analytical layer — closed 2026-05-06

Phase 2 (schema + ingest) closed 2026-05-05; the analytical layer + real-MLB
history backfill closed same-day 2026-05-06. Major shipped artifacts:

**L3 derived tables** (7):
- `f_trade_participant` — 1,275 rows; 1 per (trade × player)
- `player_movements` — 95,643 rows; refined `movement_type` (promotion / demotion /
  intra_org_lateral / waiver_or_other / trade) + `trade_id` attribution
- `f_draft_class` — 2,320 rows; outcome buckets (mlb_star/mlb_regular/mlb_callup/
  in_draft_org/traded_away/released/retired)
- `f_record_player` — 4,700 rows; UNIONs save + lahman + bref + statcast + merged
  with `--era` CLI filter; bbref_id career dedup. New `direction` column drives
  ASC vs DESC ranking (pitching contact-allowed rate stats sort ASC, "Fewest" wins).
  Save-side EV (MAX_EV/AVG_EV/HARD_HIT_PCT) computed off `f_pa_event` with
  50-BBE qualifier; calibration ~5 mph below Statcast scale (documented in
  DATA_NOTES.md).
- `f_award_career_player` — 9,953 rows; UNIONs save + merged (Lahman+mlbapi
  collapsed via bbref_id; merged filtered to non-save bbref_ids to avoid
  active-player double-count via OOTP historical-seed import).
- `f_award_franchise` — 1,856 rows
- `f_player_streak` — 2,098 rows; top-50 per (streak_id × scope), where
  scope ∈ {active, all_time}. `streak_label` from `StreakId` IntEnum.

**Real MLB history backfill** (one-time, capped at save_start_year - 1 = 2025):
- Lahman 1871-2019 (8 tables via cdalzell mirror)
- BREF 2020-2025 (2 tables via pybaseball — fills the Lahman cap)
- Statcast 2015-2025 (2 tables via Savant — EV / barrel / hard-hit)
- MLB Stats API 2018+ awards + 2019+ HOF (2 tables — fills Lahman award/HOF cap)
- Chadwick Register (1 table — bbref ↔ MLBAM crosswalk for cross-source linkage)

**CLI surface**:
- Audit: `decode`, `decode-codes`, `reconcile`, `coverage`, `advanced`
- Ingest: `ingest [<dump>] [--all] [--rebuild-only] [--force] [--no-rebuild]`
- Analytics: `draft <year> [--team]`, `records [--era] [--scope] [--category]`,
  `awards [--era] [--player] [--bbref-id] [--team] [--award]`,
  `hof [--era] [--candidates]`,
  `streaks [--all-time] [--category]`
- Setup: `fetch-history` (one-time real-history backfill, idempotent)

## What's next — Phase 3 (UI implementation)

Per [UI_DESIGN.md](UI_DESIGN.md). Build order:

1. ✅ **D13 reference scope expansion** — done 2026-05-07. Foundation
   in place for cross-era / cross-org analytical comparisons.
2. **D15 stat dictionary** Python module (~1-2 hrs) — `diamond/dictionary/`
   with formulas + KaTeX strings + display labels. Every UI screen will
   depend on this; ships before any frontend.
3. Then the rest per UI_DESIGN.md: player page → demotion/promotion → custom
   leaderboards → universes+chart-builder → AI overlay → cockpit → reviews →
   setup wizard → sync triggers.

**Open audit carry-forwards** (non-blocking, picked up opportunistically):
multi-level OPS+/ERA+ park weighting, hit_loc-based spray, LeaderCategory codes
44 + 49, trade_history `<entity:type#id>` summary parsing, personality
archetype "Type", All-Star teams 2020-2025 (Lahman caps at 2019, MLB API
doesn't expose annual rosters cleanly). All in BACKLOG.md.

**Smaller follow-ons in the analytical layer** — closed 2026-05-07:
- ✅ Pitching Statcast records — UNION'd via `direction='asc'` for rate stats.
- ✅ Save-side EV records — joined via `f_pa_event`, calibration documented.
- ✅ Awards UNION dedup — Lahman+mlbapi collapsed into `merged` via bbref_id.

All-Star teams 2020-2025 gap remains noted in BACKLOG.md (Lahman caps at
2019; MLB Stats API doesn't expose annual rosters cleanly — separate research
item if surfacing real-life All-Star streaks ever becomes important).
